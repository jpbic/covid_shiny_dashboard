about_content = '<div id="about-content">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in citywide lockdowns, social distincing, 
and travel restrictions around the entire world. Throughout 2020, it was difficult to turn 
on a TV or even speak with friends and relatives without COVID becoming a main topic of discussion. 
Unfortunately, this also led to conflicting views on the efficacy of masking, comparisons 
to other respiratory illnesses, and debates over proper public policy.<br /><br />
The goal of this dashboard is to create comparable views of confirmed cases and deaths, investigate 
changes in mortality rates over time, and develop a visual representation of outbreaks across 
nations and between US states.<br /><br />
The "Time Lapse" tab provides a view of the spread of COVID and whether the nation or state is 
experiencing an outbreak. The "Outbreak" tab allows the user to dig in to the underlying time 
lapse data to see the rolling average number of cases and exact time outbreaks begin and end. 
The "Metrics" tab shows cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, rolling average new cases and 
deaths, and mortality rate by date.<br /><br />
